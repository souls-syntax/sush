# SUSH

## Overview

SUSH -- Simple User SHell is a lightweight, Unix shell written in 
C++ by souls-syntax. This project is being actively developed as 
a personal journey to dive deeper into the world of operating 
systems (but from userspace angle). As such, SUSH is constantly
evolving, with new features and improvements being added over time.
